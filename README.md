## Overview

- ASM/C Source level debugger (ELF or stabs (bebbo gcc))
- Amiga/Neo Geo/Mega Drive emulators with frame level rewind/fast forward and simple CRT shader
- Source level profiler
- Trainer/cheat mode
- Smoke tester (record scenarios, replay, check video frames and audio identical)
- Debug peripherals for debug console and profile checkpoints
- Amiga hardware visualisers
- Neo Geo hardware visualisers
- Source level z80 debugger (z80) - see readme-z80.md for details

### Debugging Features

![Console](assets/console.png)

- UI or Console based debug
- ASM/C Syntax highlighting 
- File/function selection
- Pause / continue
- Step line / step instruction / next (step over) / step out
- Breakpoints by:
  - Absolute address
  - Symbol name
  - `file:line`
  - Clicking anywhere in the UI with an address
- Watchpoints, with filters such as:
  - Read/write/rw
  - Access size (`8|16|32`)
  - Address mask compare
  - Value/old-value/diff predicates
- Memory write (by address or by symbol)
- “Protect” (memory protection / cheat):
  - Block writes to an address (optionally sized)
  - Force a value at an address (optionally sized)
- Frame step
- Frame reverse
- Print variables

### Neo Geo Debug Peripherals

- `0xFFFF0` - characters written to this address will be output in the console and terminal
- `0xFFFEC` - write checkpoint slot index (`0-63`) for checkpoint profiling
- `0xFFE00` - checkpoint description array base (`uint32_t[64]`), write `description_ptr` to `0xFFE00 + index*4`
- These overlay with ROM addresses - other emulators or real neo geo might crash if you use these

### Amiga Debug Peripherals

- `0xFC0000` - characters written to this address will be output in the console and terminal
- `0xFC0004` - writing a long word to this address sets this as the base address of the .text section
- `0xFC0008` - writing a long word to this address sets this as the base address of the .data section
- `0xFC000C` - writing a long word to this address sets this as the base address of the .bss section
- `0xFC0010` - writing a long word to this address sets a breakpoint at the written address
- `0xFC0020` - write checkpoint slot index (`0-63`) for checkpoint profiling
- `0xFC0100` - checkpoint description array base (`uint32_t[64]`), write `description_ptr` to `0xFC0100 + index*4`
- These overlay with ROM addresses - other emulators or real Amiga might crash if you use these

### Profiling Features

![Console](assets/profile.png)

There are two complementary profiling mechanisms:

- **Streaming sampler profiler**: starts/stops sampling in the emulator.
  - Aggregates samples into “Profiler Hotspots”.
  - Analysis/export can emits a web bases results view.
- **Checkpoint profiler**: a fixed set of lightweight “checkpoints”.
  - Checkpoints are set by the target by writing to a fake peripheral
  - Captures per-checkpoint cycle segment stats (`current/avg/min/max`)
  - Captures checkpoint write scanline (`live/avg/min/max`)
  - Supports per-checkpoint descriptions via fake register arrays
  - Optional scanline overlay can be toggled from the checkpoint panel (Neo Geo and Amiga)

### Timeline / Rewind-Oriented Tools

The debugger keeps a rolling save-state timeline (“state buffer”) implemented as keyframes + diffs:

- You can use a hidden seek bar at the bottom of the emulator window to set the current frame
- When you release the seek bar, any stats saved ahead of the seek bar are trimmed
- If you want to be able to seek around without losing data, save state first "Save" from toolbar
- Restoring this with "Restore" will restore your full timeline
- Frame-step controls (frame stepping uses the state buffer)
- `loop` between two recorded frame numbers
- `diff` memory between two recorded frame numbers

### Automation / Regression Helpers

`e9k-debugger` includes first-class capture/replay tooling:

- Input recording to a file (`--record`) and replay (`--playback`)
- Smoke test recording (`--make-smoke`) and compare mode (`--smoke-test`)
  - Designed for “record inputs + frames + audio” and later replay/compare

### Neo Geo Debug Features

![Neo Geo Sprite Debug](assets/sprite_debug.png)

#### Sprite Debug

- Available via a hidden button in the emulator window - hover in top right hand corner to reveal
- Renders a full view of the Neo Geo coordinate space allowing visualsation of off screen sprites
- Renders a "sprite-line" histogram showing how close you are to hitting the Neo Geo sprites-per-line limits
- Displays a mini window showing non empty fix layer sprites
- Color sprites based on shink factor, palette usage, or sprite chain membership

#### RAM/ROM Visualiser

- View ram/rom as bitplane data
- Renders with selected palette when visible on screen

#### Palette Visualiser

- View all current palette sets as mini palette swatches
- Updates live allowing palette effects to be analysed

#### Audio Meter

- Display live audio levels from each audio source

### Amiga Custom Chipset Controls

![Amiga Custom Chipset Controls](assets/custom.png)

- Very early controls for disabling various custom chipset functions

## Trainer
- Simple training function
- Set Markers, analyse which ram addresses have changed between marker
- Protect ram locations of interest (infinite lives etc)
- Protections for matching roms are persisted, reloaded

## Save States
- e9k-debugger automaically saves a save state every frame (differential) - this allows you to rewind/fast forward etc
- When you do a "Save/Restore" it saves the entire save state buffer - this will be saved in your configured "saves" folder on exit
- Save states include a hash of the rom
- When you start if a save state is available matching the filename and hash it will be loaded ready for a restore
- This restore will include full history

## Transitions
- e9k-debugger is a playground for me to play with transitions - if you don't like them, go to the settings screen and untick "fun"

## CRT Shader
- e9k-debugger includes a relatively simple CRT shader, a settings dialog is available via a hidden button in the emulator window. Hover in the top right hand corner to reveal.

## Console Commands

### `help` (alias: `h`)

SYNOPSIS  
`help [command]`

DESCRIPTION  
Lists available commands. With an argument, prints the help/usage for that specific command (aliases are accepted).

EXAMPLES  
`help`  
`help break`  
`help b`

---

### `break` (alias: `b`)

SYNOPSIS  
`break <addr|symbol|file:line>`

DESCRIPTION  
Adds a breakpoint. Resolution order is:

1. `file:line` 
2. Hex address (24-bit; `0x` prefix optional)
3. Symbol

NOTES  
Requires a configured ELF path (Settings → `ELF`, or `--elf PATH`).

EXAMPLES  
`break 0x00A3F2`  
`break player_update`  
`break foo.c:123`

---

### `continue` (alias: `c`)

SYNOPSIS  
`continue`

DESCRIPTION  
Resumes execution defocuses the console prompt.

---

### `cls`

SYNOPSIS  
`cls`

DESCRIPTION  
Clears the console output buffer.

---

### `step` (alias: `s`)

SYNOPSIS  
`step`

DESCRIPTION  
Steps to the next source line

---

### `next` (alias: `n`)

SYNOPSIS  
`next`

DESCRIPTION  
Steps over the next line

---

### `stepi` (alias: `i`)

SYNOPSIS  
`stepi`

DESCRIPTION  
Steps a single instruction

---

### `print` (alias: `p`)

SYNOPSIS  
`print <expr> [size=8|16|32]`  
`print addr <expr> [size=8|16|32]`

DESCRIPTION  
Evaluates and prints an expression using DWARF + symbol information from the configured ELF.

- `size=8|16|32` forces the memory read size when reading from a resolved address.
- `print addr <expr>` prints the resolved runtime address for an expression.

There is also a fast path for simple numeric expressions so that dereferences like `print *0xADDR` work even without an ELF:

- `print 1234`
- `print 0x00100000`
- `print *0x00100000`
- `print *(0x00100000)`

EXAMPLES  
`print playerLives`  
`print *0x00100000 size=16`  
`print addr playerLives`

---

### `write`

SYNOPSIS  
`write <dest> <value>`

DESCRIPTION  
Writes a hex value to an address or symbol.

- If `<dest>` looks like a hex address (`0x...`), it writes directly to that address.
- Otherwise `<dest>` is treated as a symbol and resolved via the expression/symbol resolver.

The write size is inferred from the number of hex digits in `<value>`:

- `0xNN` → 8-bit
- `0xNNNN` → 16-bit
- `0xNNNNNNNN` → 32-bit

NOTES  
`<value>` must be strict hex with a `0x` prefix.

EXAMPLES  
`write 0x0010ABCD 0xFF`  
`write someGlobal 0x0001`

---

### `watch` (alias: `wa`)

SYNOPSIS  
`watch [addr|symbol] [r|w|rw] [size=8|16|32] [mask=0x...] [val=0x...|value=0x...] [old=0x...] [diff=0x...|neq=0x...] [src=...]`  
`watch del <idx>`  
`watch clear`

DESCRIPTION  
Lists, adds, or removes watchpoints.

- With no arguments, prints the current watchpoint table plus the enabled mask.
- `watch clear` resets all watchpoints.
- `watch del <idx>` removes a watchpoint by index.
- Otherwise, adds a watchpoint at `<addr|symbol>` with the selected options.

OPTIONS  
`r`, `w`, `rw` select access type. If omitted, defaults to `rw`.  
`size=8|16|32` matches access size.  
`mask=0x...` applies an address compare mask.  
`val=0x...` or `value=0x...` matches a value equality operand.  
`old=0x...` matches an old-value equality operand.  
`diff=0x...` or `neq=0x...` matches “value != old” (with an operand).
`src=...` matches the access source. Valid values depend on the current target:

- Amiga: `cpu`, `blitter`, `copper`
- Neo Geo: `cpu`

NOTES
- The debugger only shows and accepts `src=` values that can currently be emitted by the active core.
- On Amiga, source tagging is not symmetric for all access types:
  - generic RAM writes are currently tagged as `cpu` or `blitter`
  - custom-register writes are currently tagged as `cpu`, `copper`, or `blitter`
  - reads are currently only tagged as `cpu`
- Some internal paths may still report `unknown`; this is not intended as a user-facing `src=` filter value.

EXAMPLES  
`watch`  
`watch 0x0010ABCD rw size=16`  
`watch playerLives w value=0x00000003`  
`watch 0x0010ABCD w val=0x00000010`  
`watch 0x00DFF180 w src=copper`  
`watch 0x00020000 w src=blitter`  
`watch del 3`  
`watch clear`

---

### `train`

SYNOPSIS  
`train <from> <to> [size=8|16|32]`  
`train ignore`  
`train clear`

DESCRIPTION  
Convenience command for “training” by breaking on a value transition.

- `train <from> <to>` installs a watchpoint that triggers when a write changes a value from `<from>` to `<to>`.
  - `<from>` and `<to>` accept decimal or `0x...` hex.
  - The watchpoint matches any address (mask `0`).
- `train ignore` adds the last triggered watchbreak address to an ignore list.
- `train clear` clears the ignore list.

EXAMPLES  
`train 3 2 size=8`  
`train 0x03 0x02`  
`train ignore`

---

### `protect`

SYNOPSIS  
`protect`  
`protect clear`  
`protect del <addr> [size=8|16|32]`  
`protect <addr> block [size=8|16|32]`  
`protect <addr> set=0x... [size=8|16|32]`

DESCRIPTION  
Manages “protect” rules:

- `block`: prevent writes to an address (optionally sized)
- `set=...`: force a value at an address (optionally sized)

With no arguments, prints the current enabled protect entries.

EXAMPLES  
`protect`  
`protect 0x0010ABCD block size=16`  
`protect 0x0010ABCD set=0x00000063 size=8`  
`protect del 0x0010ABCD size=8`  
`protect clear`

---

### `loop`

SYNOPSIS  
`loop <from> <to>`  
`loop`  
`loop clear`

DESCRIPTION  
Loops between two recorded frame numbers (decimal) in the state buffer. Both frames must exist in the state buffer.

NOTES  
The state buffer size is configurable via `E9K_STATE_BUFFER_BYTES` (see “Runtime Requirements”).

EXAMPLES  
`loop 120 180`  
`loop`  
`loop clear`

---

### `diff`

SYNOPSIS  
`diff <fromFrame> <toFrame> [size=8|16|32]`

DESCRIPTION  
Shows RAM addresses that differ between two recorded frames (state buffer), scanning:

- Main RAM (`0x00100000` .. `0x0010FFFF`)
- Backup RAM (`0x00D00000` .. `0x00D0FFFF`)

Output is truncated after 4096 lines.

EXAMPLES  
`diff 120 180`  
`diff 120 180 size=16`

---

### `transition`

SYNOPSIS  
`transition <slide|explode|doom|flip|rbar|random|cycle|none>`

DESCRIPTION  
Sets the transition mode used for startup and fullscreen transitions and persists it to the config.

EXAMPLES  
`transition random`  
`transition none`

---

### `base`
	
SYNOPSIS  
`base [text|data|bss] [addr|clear]`
`base clear`
	
DESCRIPTION  
Shows or sets the current runtime base address for each section (`text`, `data`, `bss`). These bases are used to translate between:
	

 - **Debug/symbol addresses** (what external resolvers like `addr2line`/`readelf`/`objdump` expect)
   
In general:
 - `debug_addr = runtime_addr - <sectionBase>`
 - `runtime_addr = debug_addr + <sectionBase>`
   
This is required for relocatable images, and affects source/symbol resolution and operations like breakpoints and `print` that depend on debug info.
	
NOTES  
  - `addr` accepts decimal or `0x...`.
  - `base` values are per-session (not persisted).

EXAMPLES  
  `base`
  `base text 0x00C0FE24`
  `base data 0x00C11320`
  `base bss 0x00C1138C`
  `base text`
  `base bss clear`
  `base clear`
  
---

## Runtime Requirements

### Neo Geo BIOS ROMs (required)

BIOS files are not included. You must supply a valid Neo Geo BIOS set in the **system/BIOS directory**.

- Default system directory: `./system`
- Set via Settings UI: `BIOS FOLDER`
- Or via CLI: `--system-dir PATH` (use `--neogeo` to force Neo Geo mode)

In this repo, the default `./system` directory corresponds to `e9k-debugger/system` when running from the `e9k-debugger` directory. In practice this is typically a BIOS archive such as `neogeo.zip` (MVS / UniBIOS) or `aes.zip` (AES), placed inside the system directory.

### Game ROMS

`e9k-debugger` can load .neo files or attempt to automatically create a .neo file from a mame style rom set. 

- It uses two naming conventions:
  - the files with a rom specific file extension (.p1, .m1, .v1 etc)
  - the filename prior to the extension has a rom designation (rom-p1.bin)
- Use the ROM Folder to load mame style rom sets.

### Amiga Configuration

- Create an Amiga configuration by selecting "NEW" UAE file in the SETTINGS screen
- Amiga config is a combination of selecting PUAE core options (SETTIGNS->Core Options) and DF0/DF1/DH0 config on the settings screen
- Additional uae options can be manually added to the .uae file
- Not all PUAE core options make sense or will work (hotkeys for example) - I still haven't filtered these out
- Basic PUAE configs have been tested - large complex configs will not work well with the state saving buffer

### Amiga Kickstart ROMs (required)

- Kickstart ROMS are not included.
- A complete set of WHDLoad kickstart roms in your system folder is the best option.
- Otherwise manually settting kickstart roms in the .uae file is required.
- The AROS kickstart will be a fallback and may work depending on your usage.

### Linux/BSD

- zenity for file dialogs

### Toolchain 

For C source-level stepping, symbol breakpoints, and rich `print` expressions:

Configure your toolchain for each platform in the settings screen. Currently tested:

- Neo Geo - ngdevkit `m68k-neogeo-elf`
- Amiga - bebbo's amiga-gcc `m68k-amigaos`
- Mega Drive - mars/sgdk `m68k-elf`

Without these, the debugger can still run, but symbol/source-aware features degrade or become unavailable.

#### Neo Geo
- An ELF compiled with DWARF debug info (`Settings → ELF`, or `--elf PATH`)
- The Neo Geo toolchain binaries on `PATH`:
  - `m68k-neogeo-elf-addr2line`
  - `m68k-neogeo-elf-objdump`
  - `m68k-neogeo-elf-readelf`
  
#### Mega Drive
- An ELF compiled with DWARF debug info (`Settings → ELF`, or `--elf PATH`)
- The toolchain binaries on `PATH`:
  - `m68k-elf-addr2line`
  - `m68k-elf-objdump`
  - `m68k-elf-readelf`

#### Amiga
- To use bebbo's toolchain please use https://github.com/AmigaPorts/m68k-amigaos-gcc - it contains important fixes to addr2line
- An hunk compiled with amiga-gcc debug info 
- The amiga-os-gcc binaries on `PATH`:
  - `m68k-amigaos-addr2line`
  - `m68k-amigaos-objdump`
  
Note: Amiga debugging is complicated by relocation. If your target application is relocated you must inform the debugger of the base address of each section. This can be done with either"

- The `base` command - see "base" command documentation
- Makeing your custom loader use the Amiga fake perphierals - see "Amiga Debug Peripherals" section
- Use `load9000` amiga program to load your hunk based exectuable - see "load9000" section

- An ELF image with dwarf information running on Amiga should technically work but is untested

### load9000

A simple Amiga program is available in:

`tools/amiga/load9000`

This program is run on the emulated Amiga and parses the hunk section table before calling `LoadSeg`.

`load9000` will load your application, inform the debugger of your section base addresses and then optionally set a breakpoint at the entry point.

`load9000 <hunk>`
`load9000 --break <hunk>`

### Config file + environment variables

Config is persisted automatically (layout + settings):

- macOS: `~/.e9k-debugger.cfg`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\\e9k-debugger.cfg` (falls back to `%USERPROFILE%`)

Useful environment variables:

- `E9K_STATE_BUFFER_BYTES`: state buffer capacity (default is `512*1024*1024`)
- `E9K_PROFILE_JSON`: output path for profiler analysis JSON (otherwise a temp file is used)

### Command-line options

Run `e9k-debugger --help` for the full list. The current options include:

#### Global options
- `--help`, `-h`
- `--reset-cfg` (deletes the saved config file and restarts)
- `--amiga`, `--neogeo` (sets the active system; affects which config options apply)
- `--core PATH` (applies to the active system)
- `--system-dir PATH` (applies to the active system)
- `--save-dir PATH` (applies to the active system)
- `--source-dir PATH` (applies to the active system)
- `--audio-buffer-ms MS` (currently Neo Geo only)
- `--window-size WxH`
- `--record PATH`, `--playback PATH`
- `--make-smoke PATH`, `--smoke-test PATH`, `--smoke-open`
- `--headless` - hide the main window (also disables rolling state recording by default)
- `--warp` - start in speed multiplier mode
- `--fullscreen` (alias: `--start-fullscreen`) - start in UI fullscreen mode (ESC toggle)
- `--no-rolling-record` - start with rolling state recording paused (can be toggled with `F4`; smoke/headless also pause by default)

#### Neo Geo options (use with `--neogeo`)
- `--elf PATH`
- `--rom PATH` (Neo Geo `.neo` file)
- `--rom-folder PATH` (generates a `.neo`)

#### Amiga options (use with `--amiga`)
- `--hunk PATH` (Amiga debug binary path)
- `--uae PATH` (Amiga UAE config `.uae` path)
